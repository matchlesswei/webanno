== Projects

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *project managers* (managers of existing projects), 
      *project creators* (users with the ability to create new projects), and *administrators*.
      Project managers only see projects in which they hold the respective roles. Project creators
      only see projects in which they hold the project manager role.

This is the place to specify/edit annotation projects.  
You can either select one of the existing projects for editing, or click *Create Project* to add a project.

Although correction and automation projects function similarly, the management differs after the creation of the document. For further description, look at the corresponding chapters <<sect_automation>> and <<sect_correction>>.

Only admins are allowed to create projects.	
Click on *Create Project* to create a new project. 

image::project1.jpg[align="center"]

After doing so, a new pane is displayed, where you can name and describe your new project. It is also important to chose the kind of project you want to create. You have the choice between annotation, automation, and correction.
Please do not forget to save.

image::project2.jpg[align="center"]

After saving the details of the new project, it can be treated like any other already existing one.  Also, a new pane with many options to organize the project is displayed.

image::project10.jpg[align="center"]

To delete a project, click on it in the frame *Details*. The project details are displayed. Now, click on *Delete*.

The pane with the options to organize and edit a project, as described above, can also be reached by clicking on the desired project in the left frame.

image::project3.jpg[align="center"]

By clicking on the tabs, you can now set up the chosen project. 

=== Users

After clicking on *Users*, you are displayed a new pane in which you can add new users by clicking on the button *Add User*.  After doing so, you get a list of users in the system which can be added to the project. By making a tick in front of the login, you can chose a new user.

image::project4.jpg[align="center"]

Please do not forget to save after choosing all members of the project. Close the pane by clicking on *Cancel*. The rights of users created like this are that of an annotator. If you want to expand the user's status, you can do so by clicking on the user and then on *Change Permission*. The following frame will pop up.

image::project5.jpg[align="center"]

After ticking the wished permissions, click on *Update*.
To remove a user, click on the login and then *Remove User*.

=== Documents

To add or delete documents, you have to click on the tab *Documents* in the project pane. Two frames will be displayed. In the first frame you can import new documents.

image::project6.jpg[align="center"]

Choose a document by clicking on *Choose Files*. Please mind the format, which you have to choose above. Then click on *Import Document*. 
The imported documents can be seen in the frame below.
To delete a document from the project, you have to click on it and then click on *Delete* in the right lower corner.

[[sect_projects_layers]]
=== Layers 

In WebAnno, all annotations belong to an annotation *layer*. Each layer has a structural *type* that defines if it is a *span*, a *relation*, or a *chain*. It also defines how the annotations behave and what kind of features it carries.

==== Creating a custom layer

This section provides a short walkthrough on the creation of a custom layer. The following sections act as reference documentation providing additional details on each step. In the following example, we will create a custom layer called *Sentiment* with a feature called *Polarity* that can be *negative*, *neutral*, or *positive*.

. Create the layer _Sentiment_
  * Go to the *Layers* tab in your project's settings and press the *Create layer* button
  * Enter the name of the layer in *Layer name*: _Sentiment_
  * Choose the *type* of the layer: _Span_
  * Enable *Allow multiple tokens* because we want to mark sentiments on spans longer than a single token.
  * Press the *Save layer* button
. Create the feature _Polarity_
  * Press the *New feature* button
  * Choose the *type* of the feature: _uima.cas.String_
  * Enter the *name* of the feature: _Polarity_
  * Press *Save feature*
. Create the tagset _Polarity values_
  * Go to the *Tagsets* tab and press *Create tagset*
  * Enter the *name* of the tagset: _Polarity values_
  * Press *Save tagset*
  * Press *Create tag*, enter the *name* of the tag: _negative_, press *Save tag*
  * Repeat for _neutra_ and _positive_
. Assign the tagset _Polarity values_ to the feature _Polarity_
  * Back in the *Layers* tab, select the layer: _Sentiment_ and select the feature: _Polarity_
  * Set the *tagset* to _Polarity values_
  * Press *Save feature*

Now you have created your first custom layer.

==== Built-in layers

WebAnno comes with a set of built-in layers that allow you to start annotating immediately. Also, many import/export formats only work with these layers as their semantics are known to WebAnno. For this reason, the ability to customize the behaviors of built-in layers is limited and it is not possible to extend them with custom features.

.Built-in layers
[cols="1,2,2v", options="header"]
|====
| Layer | Type | Enforced behaviors

| Chunk
| Span
| Lock to multiple tokens,
no stacking,
no sentence boundary crossing

| Coreference
| Chain
| _(no enforced behaviors)_

| Dependency
| Relation over POS,
| No stacking,
no sentence boundary crossing

| Lemma
| Span
| Locked to token offsets,
no stacking,
no sentence boundary crossing

| Named Entity
| Span
| _(no enforced behaviors)_

| Part of Speech (POS)
| Span
| Locked to token offsets,
no stacking,
no sentence boundary crossing
|====

The coloring of the layers signal the following: 

.Color legend
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Color
| Description

| green
| built-in annotation layer, enabled

| blue
| custom annotation layer, enabled

| red
| disabled annotation layer
|===

To create a custom layer, select *Create Layer* in the *Layers* frame. Then, the following frame will be displayed. 

[[sect_projects_layers_properties]]
==== Properties 

image::layer1.jpg[align="center"]

.Properites
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|====
| Property | Description

| Layer name
| The name of the layer (obligatory)

| Description
| A description of the layer. This information will be shown in a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the layer name in the annotation detail editor panel.

| Enabled
| Whether the layer is enabled or not. Layers can currently not be deleted, but they can be disabled.
|====

NOTE: When a layer is first created, only ASCII characters are allowed for the layer name because WebAnno derives an internal UIMA type name from the initial layer name. After the layer has been created, the name can be changed arbitrarily. The internal UIMA type name will not be updated. The internal UIMA name is
e.g. used when exporting data or in constraint rules.

image::layer2.jpg[align="center"]

[[sect_projects_layers_technical_properties]]
==== Technical Properties 

In the frame *Technical Properties*, the user may select the type of annation that will be made with this layer: span, relation, or chain.

.Technical Properites
[cols="1v,2", options="header"]
|====
| Property | Description

| Internal name
| Internal UIMA type name

| Type
| The type of the layer (obligatory, see below)

| Attach to layer
_(Relations)_
| Determines which span layer a relation attaches to. Relations can only be created between annotations of this span layer.
|====

The layer type defines the structure of the layer. WebAnno supports three different types.

.Layer types
[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|====
| Type 
| Description 
| Example

| Span
| Continous segment of text delimited by a start and end character offset. The example shows two spans.
| image:project_layer_type_span.png[]

| Relation
| Binary relation between two spans visualized as an arc between spans. The example shows a relation between two spans.
| image:project_layer_type_relation.png[]

| Chain
| Directed sequence of connected spans in which each span connects to the following one. The example shows a single chain consisting of three connected spans.
| image:project_layer_type_chain.png[]
|====

For relation annotations the type of the spans which are to be connected can be chosen in the field *Attach to layer*. Here, only non-default layers are displayed. To create a relation, first the span annotation needs to be created.

NOTE: Currently for each span layer there can be at most one relation layer attaching to it.

NOTE: It is currently not possible to create relations between spans in different layers. For example if you define span layers called *Men* and *Women*, it is impossible to define a relation layer *Married to* between the two. To work around this limitation, create a single span layer *Person* with a feature *Gender* instead. You can now set the feature *Gender* to *Man* or *Woman* and eventually define a relation layer *Married to* attaching to the *Person* layer.

[[sect_projects_layers_behaviours]]
==== Behaviours

.Behaviors
[cols="1v,2", options="header"]
|====
| Behavior | Description

| Read-only
| The layer may be viewed but not edited.

| Lock to token offsets
_(span, chain)_
| Annotation boundaries are forced to coincide with token boundaries. If the selection is smaller than a token, the annotation is expanded to the next larger token covering the selection. If the selection covers multiple tokens, the annotation is reduced to the first covered token.

| Allow multiple tokens
_(span, chain)_
| Like _Lock to token offsets_ except that the annotation may cover multiple tokens. If this is enabled, then _Lock to token offsets_ is automatically disabled.

| Allow stacking
| Allow multiple annotations in this layer to be made at exactly the same position. If this option is disabled, a new annotation made at the same location as an existing annotation will replace the existing annotation.

| Allow crossing sentence boundary
_(chain)_
| Allow annotations to cross sentence boundaries.

| Behave like a linked list
| Controls what happens when two chains are connected with each other. If this option is *disabled*, then the two entire chains will be merged into one large chain. Links between spans will be changed so that each span connects to the closest following span -  no arc labels are displayed. If this option is *enabled*, then the chains will be split if necessary at the source and target points, reconnecting the spans such that exactly the newly created connection is made - arc labels are available.
|====

NOTE: In order to create sub-token annotations, both *Lock to token offsets* and *Allow multiple tokens* need to be disabled.

[[sect_projects_layers_features]]
==== Features

image::layer3.jpg[align="center"]

In this section, features and their properties can be configured. 

NOTE: When a feature is first created, only ASCII characters are allowed for the feature name because WebAnno derives an internal UIMA name from the initial layer name. After the feature has been created, the name can be changed arbitrarily. The internal UIMA feature name will not be updated. The internal UIMA name is
e.g. used when exporting data or in constraint rules.

.Feature properties
[cols="1v,2", options="header"]
|====
| Property | Description

| Internal name
| Internal UIMA feature name

| Type
| The type of the feature (obligatory, see below)

| Name
| The name of the feature (obligatory)

| Description
| A description that is shown when the mouse hovers over the feature name in the annotation detail editor panel.

| Enabled
| Features cannot be deleted, but they can be disabled

| Show
| Whether the feature value is shown in the annotation label. If this is disabled, the feature is only visible in the annotation detail editor panel.

| Remember
| Whether the annotation detail editor should carry values of this feature
over when creating a new annotation of the same type. This can be useful when creating many annotations
of the same type in a row.

| Tagset
_(String)_
| The tagset controlling the possible values for a string feture.
|====

WebAnno supports the following feature types.

.Feature types
[cols="1v,2", options="header"]
|====
| Type | Description

| uima.cas.String
| Textual feature that can optionally be controlled by a tagset. It is rendered as a text field or as a combobox if a tagset is defined.

| uima.cas.Boolean
| Boolean feature that can be true or false and is rendered as a checkbox.

| uima.cas.Integer
| Numeric feature for integer numbers.

| uima.cas.Float
| Numeric feature for decimal numbers.

| uima.tcas.Annotation
_(Span layers)_
| Link feature that can point to any arbitrary span annotation

| _other span layers_
_(Span layers)_
| Link feature that can point only to the selected span layer.
|====

NOTE: Please take care that when working with non-custom layers, they have to be ex- and imported, if you want to use the resulting files in e.g. correction projects.

=== Tagsets

To administer the tagsets, click on the tab *Tagsets* in the project pane. 

image::project7.jpg[align="center"]

To administer one of the existing tagsets, select it by a click. Then, the tagset characteristics are displayed.

image::project8.jpg[align="center"]

In the Frame *Tagset details*, you can change them,  export a tagset, save the changes you made on it or delete it by clicking on *Delete tagset*.
To change an individual tag, you select one in the list displayed in the frame *Tags*. You can then change its description or name or delete it by clicking *Delete tag* in *Tag details*.  Please do not forget to save your changes by clicking on *Save tag*.
To add a new tag, you have to click on *Create tag* in *Tag details*. Then you add the name and the description, which is optional. Again, do not forget to click *Save tag* or the new tag will not be created.

To create an own tagset, click on *Create tagset* and fill in the fields that will be displayed in the new frame. Only the first field is obligatory. Adding new tags works the same way as described for already existing tagsets. If you want to have a free annotation, as it could be used for lemma or meta information annotation, do not add any tags. 

image::project_tagset_new.jpg[align="center"]

To export a tagset, choose the format of the export at the bottom of the frame and click *Export tagset*.

=== Constraints

To import a constraints file, go to *Project* and click on the particular project name. On the left side of the screen, a tab bar opens. Choose *Constraints*. You can now choose a constraint file by clicking on *Choose Files*. Then, click on *Import*. Upon import, WebAnno checks if the constraints file is well formed. If they conform to the rules of writing constraints, the constraints are applied. 

=== Guidelines

To add or delete guidelines, which will be accessible by users in the project, you have to select the tab *Guidelines*. Two new frames will be displayed.
To upload guidelines, click on *Choose files* in the first frame ‚Äì *Add guideline document*, select a file from your local disc and then click *Import guidelines*.

image::project9.jpg[align="center"]

Uploaded guidelines are displayed in the second frame ‚Äì *Guideline documents*.
To delete a guideline document, click on it and then on *Delete* in the right lower corner of the frame.

=== Import

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *administrators*.

Projects are associated with the accounts of users that act as project managers, annotators, or
curators. When importing a previously exported project, you can choose to automatically *generate
missing users* (enabled by default). If this option is disabled, projects still maintain their
association to users by name. If the respective user accounts are created manually after the import,
the users will start showing up in the projects.

NOTE: Generated users are disabled and have no password. They must be explicitly enabled and a
      password must be set before the users can log in again.

=== Export

image::project_export.jpg[align="center"]

WebAnno offers two modes of exporting projects:

   * *Export the whole project* for the purpose of creating a backup, of migrating it to a new WebAnno version, of migrating to a different WebAnno instance, or simply in order to reimport it as a duplicate copy.
   * *Export curated documents* for the purpose of getting an easy access to the final annotation results. If you do not have any curated documents in your project, this export option is not offered.

The format of the exported annotations is selected using the *Format* drop-down field. When *AUTO*
is selected, the file format corresponds to the format of the source document. If WebAnno has not
write support for the source format, the file is exported in the WebAnno TSV format instead.

IMPORTANT: Do not leave the export page after initiating an export before the progress bar is 
           complete or your WebAnno instance can become locked until it is restarted!

NOTE: Some browsers automatically extract ZIP files into a folder after the download. Zipping this
      folder and trying to re-import it into WebAnno will generally not work because the process
      introduces an additional folder within the archive and WebAnno is unable to handle that. The
      best option is to disable the automatic extraction in your browser. E.g. in Safari, go to
      *Preferences* -> *General* and disable the setting *Open "safe" files after downloading*.

When exporting a whole project, the structure of the exported ZIP file is as follows:

====
* *<project ID>.json* - project metadata file
* *annotation*
** *<source document name>*
*** *<user ID>.XXX* - file representing the annotations for this user in the selected format. 
* *annotation_ser*
** *<source document name>*
*** *<user ID>.ser* - serialized CAS file representing the annotations for this user
* *curation*
** *<source document name>*
*** *CURATION_USER.XXX* - file representing the state of curation in the selected format.
*** *CORRECTION_USER.XXX* - _correction_ project: original document state, _automation_ project 
    automatically generated suggestions
* *curation_ser*
** *<source document name>*
*** *CURATION_USER.ser* - serialized UIMA CAS representing the state of curation
*** *CORRECTION_USER.ser* - _correction_ project: original document state, _automation_ project 
    automatically generated suggestions
* *log*
** *<project ID>.log* - project log file
* *source* - folder containing the original source files
====

NOTE: The files under `annotation` and `curation` are provided for convenience only. They are 
      ignored upon import.

Currently, WebAnno does not allow the user to choose a specific format for bulk-exporting annotations. However, link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/webanno-user/X3ShaFPXQT0/PnBzpPdXrIgJ[this mailing list post] describes how link:https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/[DKPro Core] can be used to transform the UIMA CAS formats into alternative formats.
