== Annotation

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *annotators*, *project managers*, and 
      *administrators*. Annotators and project managers only see projects in which
      they hold the respective roles. 

=== Opening a Document

When navigating to the *Annotation* page, a dialogue opens that allows you to select a project, and 
a document within the project. If you want to open a different project or document later, click on 
*Open* to open the dialog.

image::version3_annotation1.png[align="center"]

Projects appear as folders, and contain the documents of the project. Double-click on a document to 
open it for annotation. Document names written in black show that the document has not been opened 
by the current user, blue font means that it has already been opened, whereas red font indicates 
that the document has already been marked as *done*.

=== Navigation

Sentence  numbers  on  the  left  side  of  the  annotation  page  show  the  exact sentence numbers in the document. 

image::annotation3.jpg[align="center"]

The arrow buttons *first page*, *next page*, *previous page*, *last page*, and *go to page* allow you to navigate accordingly. The *Prev.* and *Next* buttons in the *Document* frame allow you to go to the previous or next document on your project list. You can also use the following keyboard assignments in order to navigate only using your keyboard.

.Navigation key bindings
|====
| Key | Action 

| *HOME*
| jump to first sentence

| *END*
| jump to last sentence

| *PAGE DOWN*
| move to the next page, if not in the last page already

| *PAGE UP*
| move to previous page, if not already in the first page

| *SHIFT+PAGE DOWN*
| go to next document in project, if available

| *SHIFT+PAGE UP* 
| go to previous document in project, if available
|====

A click on the *Help* button displays the Guidelines for the tool and *The Annotator's Guide to NER-Annotation*.
When you are finished with annotating or curating a document, please click on the *Done*
button, so that the document may be further processed. If the button above the *Done* is a cross symbol, it means the documents have already been finished. If the symbol has a tick, it is still open.

Annotation of spans works by selecting the span, or double-clicking on a word. This activates the *Actions*-box on the right, where you can choose a layer. One can also type in the initial letters and chose the needed layer. After having chosen a layer, the drop-down menu inside the *Features*-box displays the features you can use during the annotation. The tag can be selected out of the drop-down menu inside the *Features*-box which contains the tags of the chosen layer.

image::annotation_edit_version3.png[align="center"]

To change or delete an annotation, double-click on the annotation (span or link annotations). The *Actions*-box is now activated. Changes and Deletions are possible via the respective buttons. 

Link annotations (between POS tags) are created by selecting the starting POS-tag, then dragging the arrow to connect it to its target POS tag. All possible targets are highlighted. 

image::annotation_pos_span.jpg[align="center"]


=== Creating annotations

To create annotations, you have mainly two options:

* select a span of text to create a span annotation
* click on an existing span annotation and drag an arc to another span annotation

The definition of layers is covered in section <<sect_projects_layers>>.

==== Spans

To create an annotation over a span of text, click with the mouse on the text and drag the mouse to create a selection. When you release the mouse, the selected span is activated and highlighted in orange. The annotation detail editor is updated to display the text you have currently selected and to offer a choice on which layer the annotation is to be created. As soon as a layer has been selected, it is automatically assigned to the selected span. To delete an annotation, select a span and click on *Delete*. To deactivate a selected span, click on *Clear*.

Depending on the layer behavior configuration, spans annotations can have any length, can overlap,
can stack, can nest, and can cross sentence boundaries. 

.Example
For example, for NE annotation, select the options as shown below (red check mark):

image::annotation2.jpg[align="center"]

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition[NE] annotation can be chosen from a tagset and can span over several tokens within one sentence. Nested NE annotations are also possible (in the example below: "Frankfurter" in "Frankfurter FC"). 

image::annotation_ner.jpg[align="center"]

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_%28morphology%29[Lemma] annotation, as shown below, is freely selectable over a single token.

image::annotation_lemma.jpg[align="center"]

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech[POS] can be chosen over one token out of a tagset.

image::annotation_pos.jpg[align="center"]

.Zero-width spans
To create a zero-length annotation, hold *SHIFT* and click on the position where you wish to create the annotation. To avoid accidental creations of zero-length annotations, a simple single-click triggers no action by default. The *lock to token* behavior cancels the ability to create zero-length annotations.

NOTE: A zero-width span between two tokens that are directly adjacent, e.g. the full stop at the
      end of a sentence and the token before it (`end.`) is always considered to be *at the end of the
      first token* rather than at the beginning of the next token. So an annotation between `d` and `.`
      in this example would rendered at the right side of `end` rather than at the left side of `.`. 

.Forward annotation
To improve the speed of POS-annotation, select *forward annotation* in the *Actions* box on the left side of your screen. This allows you to select POS-tags via the keys of your keyboard. Pushing a key several times successively proposes every POS-tag starting with the respective letter inside the *Features* box. Pressing a key whose letter does not represent the beginning of any tag leads to the first tag in the tagset. Once a POS-tag has been selected, pushing *space* and *Enter* keys automatically assigns the POS-tag to the token in focus and the next token can be annotated as described. Note that the *Enter* key will not work for the *Safari* browser. Also the *Forward annotation* works only for span annotations with 1) *tagset* and 2) a layer with only one *feature*.

image::key_binding_POS.png[align="center"]

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference[Co-reference] annotation can be made over several tokens within one sentence. A single token sequence has several co-ref spans simultaneously.

==== Relations

To create a relation annotation, click on a span annotation and drag the mouse to another span
annotation. While you drag, an arc is drawn. It is not possible to create arbitrary relation
annotations. In order to create one, a corresponding relation layer needs to be defined between
the source and target spans.

Depending on the layer behavior configuration, relation annotations can stack, can cross each other,
and can cross sentence boundaries.

.Self-looping relations
To create a relation from a span to itself, press the *SHIFT* key before starting to drag the mouse
and hold it until you release the mouse button.

To abort the creation of an annotation, hold the *CTRL* key when you release the mouse button.

NOTE: Currently, there can be at most one relation layer per span layer. Relations between spans
      of different layers are not supported.

NOTE: Not all arcs displayed in the annotation view are belonging to chain or relation layers. Some
      are induced by <<sect_annotation_link_features>>.

When moving the mouse over an annotation with outgoing relations, the info popup includes the
*yield* of the relations. This is the text transitively covered by the outgoing relations. This
is useful e.g. in order to see all text governed the head of a particular dependency relation.
The text may be abbreviated.

.Example of the yield of a dependency relation
image::annotation_relation_yield.png[align="center"]

==== Chains

A chain layer includes both, span and relation annotations, into a single structural layer. Creating
a span annotation in a chain layer basically creates a chain of length one. Creating a relation
between two chain elements has different effects depending on whether the *linked list* behavior
is enabled for the chain layer or not. To enable or disable the *linked list* behaviour, go to *Layers*
in the *Projects Settings* mode. After choosing *Coreference*, *linked list* behaviour
is displayed in the checkbox and can either be marked or unmarked.

.Configuration of a chain layer in the project settings

.Example of chain annotations
image::annotation_span_many.jpg[align="center"]

To abort the creation of an annotation, hold *CTRL* when you release the mouse button.

.Chain behavior
|====
| Linked List | Condition | Result

| disabled
| the two spans are already in the same chain
| nothing happens

| disabled
| the two spans are in different chains
| the two chains are merged

| enabled
| the two spans are already in the same chains
| the chain will be re-linked such that a chain link points from the source to the target span, 
  potentially creating new chains in the process.

| enabled
| the two spans are in different chains
| the chains will be re-linked such that a chain link points from the source to the target span, 
  merging the two chains and potentially creating new chains from the remaining prefix and suffix
  of the original chains.
|====

==== Primitive Features

Supported primitive features types are string, boolean, integer, and float.
Boolean features are displayed as a checkbox that can either be marked or unmarked. Integer and 
float features are displayed using a number field. String features are displayed using a text field
or - in case they have a tagset - using a combobox.

[[sect_annotation_link_features]]
==== Link Features

Link features can be used to link one annotation to others. Before a link can be made, a slot with 
a role must be added. Enter the role label in the text field and press the *add* button to create
the slot. Next, click on field in the newly created slot to *arm* it. The field's color will change
to indicate that it is armed. Now you can fill the slot by double-clicking on a span 
annotation. To remove a slot, arm it and then press the *del* button.

==== Choosing Layers

* Choose one of the predefined layers in the *Actions* box on the right side of the screen.
 
The *Actions* box always shows the presently activated layer, the *Features* box shows the layer of the activated instance. Subsequently, the settings of the two boxes can differ. To change settings during the annotation process, cancel the previously selected layer by clicking on *Clear* in the *Action* box and choose a new layer.

==== Changing role names

To change a previously selected role name, no prior deletion is needed. Just double-click on the instance you want to change, it will be highlighted in orange, and chose another role name.

=== Settings

Once the document is opened, a default of 5 sentences is loaded on the annotation  page.  The  
*Settings*  button will  allow  you  to specify the settings of the annotation layer.

image::annotation_settings.png[align="center"]

Next to *Annotation layers*, you to select the annotation layer which is displayed during annotation.
This is useful to reduce clutter if there are many annotation layers. Mind that hiding a layer which
has relations attached to it will also hide the respective relations. E.g. if you disable POS, then
no dependency relations will be visible anymore.

The *Remember layer* checkbox controls if the annotation layer selected in the *Actions* box. It will work as main layer during the annotation process. Only instances of this layer will be created, even if an annotation in another layer is selected. If necessary, it is possible to change active instances. Still, if a new instance is selected, the main layer is automatically activated.

The *Sidebar size* controls the width of the sidebar containing the annotation detail edtior and 
actions box. In particular on small screens, increasing this can be useful. The sidebar can be 
configured to take between 10% and 50% of the screen.

The *Number of sentences* controls how many sentences are visible in the annotation area. The more
sentences are visible, the slower the user interface will react.

The *Auto-scroll* setting controls if the annotation view is centered on the sentence in which the
last annotation was made. This can be useful to avoid manual navigation.

If *Use the same color for all tags in a layer* is chosen, annotations are colored per layer. If this option
is off, then annotations are colored by their labels (all annotations with the same label also have
the same color). Mind that there is a limited number of colors such that eventually colors will
be reused.

=== Export

Annotations are always immediately persistent in the backend database. Thus, it is not necessary to  save the annotations explicitly. Also, losing the connection through network issues or timeouts does not cause data loss. To obtain a local copy of the current document, click on *export* button. The following frame will appear:

image::annotation_export.jpg[align="center"]

Choose your preferred format. Please take note of the facts that the plain text format does not contain any annotations and that the files in the binary format need to be unpacked before further usage. For further information the supported formats, please consult the corresponding chapter <<sect_formats>>.

The document will be saved to your local disk, and can be re-imported via adding the document to a project by a project administrator. Please export your data periodically, at least when finishing a document or not continuing annotations for an extended period of time.
